**Sentiment Analysis for Movie Reviews**

This project focuses on sentiment analysis applied to movie reviews, aiming to classify the sentiment expressed in the text as positive, negative, or neutral. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, particularly machine learning algorithms, this model determines the emotional tone of movie reviews to gauge audience reactions.

**Key Features:**

Data Collection: Utilizes a diverse dataset of movie reviews sourced from reputable platforms or databases.
Preprocessing: Implements text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling special characters to prepare the data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Utilizes various NLP techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to represent textual data numerically.
Modeling: Implements machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Recurrent Neural Networks) to train and classify sentiments in the reviews.
Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge its effectiveness in sentiment classification.

**Usage: **

Training the Model: Users can train the sentiment analysis model using the provided dataset or their custom datasets.
Prediction: Enables users to input new movie reviews and get predictions regarding the sentiment expressed in the text.
Evaluation: Facilitates assessing the model's performance using various evaluation metrics.
